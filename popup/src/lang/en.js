This browser add-on aims to support the organization of collective actions of citizens on the General Data Protection Regularion (GDPR) compliance issues.

These actions make it possible to file a complaint and claim damages for the damage suffered.

We do not collect any data automatically: we only collect the URL of the site for which you wish to alert us, and your email for the time it takes to confirm your humanity.

If you have any questions: https://warninggoose.net`,
